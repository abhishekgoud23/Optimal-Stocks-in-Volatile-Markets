# Optimal-Stocks-in-Volatile-Markets

In this project, our primary goal is to meticulously assess the top 3 banking stocks within the S&P 500 index, with the ultimate aim of singling out the most promising investment opportunity. To do this, we employ a multifaceted approach that blends robust financial modeling, an in-depth examination of each stock's resilience during the tumultuous COVID-19 period, and even venture into the realm of price prediction.
